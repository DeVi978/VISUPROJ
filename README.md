**Visualization Project 2022**:
In this visualization project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) on IPL 2008-2019 dataset by exploring through various statistical queries
that might interest an inquisitive cricket mind and answered them in a visual way for ease of capturing the data analysis results.

**Dataset Source**: <https://www.kaggle.com/anuranroy/ipldatasets>. The csv files used for this Exploratory Data Analysis are deliveries2.csv and matches.csv. 

The R code for the Exploratory Data Analysis is in file ipl.R and the pdf output is in file ipl.pdf.

**Visualization Project 2022**:
In this visualization project, I have performed Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) on IPL 2008-2019 dataset by exploring through various statistical queries
that might interest an inquisitive cricket mind and answered them in a visual way for ease of capturing the data analysis results.

**Dataset Source**: <https://www.kaggle.com/anuranroy/ipldatasets>. The csv files used for this Exploratory Data Analysis are "deliveries2.csv" and "matches.csv". 

**Data Analysis**: The R Markdown code for the Exploratory Data Analysis of the above datasets is in file "ipl.Rmd" and the corresponding pdf output is file "ipl.pdf".

**Shiny App Link**: <https://lllf.shinyapps.io/ipl_2008-2019/>. The R code for this is in file "ipl.R".

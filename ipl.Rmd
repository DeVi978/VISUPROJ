## Introduction

The Indian Premier League (**IPL**) is a Men's T20 franchise cricket league of India that started in 2008. In 2010, the IPL became the first sporting event in the world to be broadcast live on YouTube. The brand value of the IPL in 2019 was â‚¹47,500 crore (US\$5.9 billion). The IPL is the most-attended cricket league in the world and in 2014 was ranked sixth by average attendance among all sports leagues. In this visualization project, we are gonna perform Exploratory Data Analysis (**EDA**) on IPL 2008-2019 dataset by exploring through various statistical queries that might interest an inquisitive cricket mind.

## Dataset & Variables

The dataset comprises of 2 csv files:

-   **deliveries2.csv**: This dataset consists of 179078 rows and 22 columns. It contains ball-by-ball delivery-wise statistics of every match played in the period 2008-2019. The variables are as follows:

```{r}
